//This issue is quite hard as the random controll would require a lot of work. Currently the best idea is to have a strategy-seed stream and give out fized seed for each agents strategy. 
//This would require agents to have the same number of strategies and we give out seeds by looping through strategies and then agents. (Giving out seed to the first strategy for each agent etc..).
