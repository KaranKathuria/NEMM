/*
 * Version info:
 *     File defining the Analysis Agent class. This agent is currently implemented simply by only having a parameter given price expectation.
 *     For future development each analysis agent can have differen price expectations or even different strategies for determining price expectations based on future and historic values. 
 *     For instance a method similar to that of the ElFarol implementation but which also incorporates future variables.
